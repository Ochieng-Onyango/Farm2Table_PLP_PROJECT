### Farm2Table Application

#### For Farmers:
Farmers start by registering on the Farm2Table platform, providing their personal and farm details, including name, email, password, and location. Once registered, farmers gain access to a dedicated farmer dashboard.

In the farmer dashboard, they can manage their farm's profile, update their information, and add captivating images showcasing their farm and poultry. Farmers can list their poultry products, providing details such as product name, description, category, and setting competitive prices.

When a customer places an order for their poultry, farmers receive notifications in their dashboard. They can view and manage order details, updating the order status from pending to shipped to delivered. The platform facilitates direct communication between farmers and customers, allowing farmers to respond to inquiries, address concerns, and provide updates on product availability or special offerings.
